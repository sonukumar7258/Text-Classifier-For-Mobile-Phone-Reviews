The Samsung Galaxy A50 offers a handsome design and decent midrange specs, but it's not quite enough to compete with the Google Pixel 3a.
The Samsung Galaxy A71 offers 5G connectivity and solid overall performance for a relatively affordable price.
The Galaxy S20 Ultra is too big, too heavy, too expensive, and its camera struggles with focus issues.
The Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is a big, powerful phone that's good for artists and note-takers.
I have been using this phone for 3 months now one thing I don't like about this Samsung Galaxy A30s is that he doesn't have a recording calls
I purchased J7 on January, I had a display problem after 5 months, Samsung doesn't cover warranty for the specific issue.
I have been a SAMSUNG user of their J3 & J7 ANDROID phones for several years,The SAMSUNG J7 has everything I need for my everyday and evening use.
I have NEVER had a problem with any of the applications that I use on a daily basis,SAMSUNG is a quality product that I look for in a mobile product.
The J7 fits comfortably in my hand as opposed to other devices that I have looked at and held.
The bottom line is that the SAMSUNG J7 is the mobile device I would purchase again if it is available when my current phone needs to be replaced.
I would recommend the SAMSUNG J7 to anyone that is looking for a replacement cell phone as a new user of an ANDROID. 
I always look to get another Samsung when trading up,The camera takes great pictures.
