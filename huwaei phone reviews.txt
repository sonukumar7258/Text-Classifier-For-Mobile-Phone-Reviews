The Huawei P40 Pro 5G is an impressive smartphone with a fantastic screen.
I just had my huawei p20,This is my second phone and i am used to my iphone,the camera is good and pretty fast chip,Good for its price.
I Bought my Huawei P30 Lite a year and a half ago and it's still in pristine condition. I am totally satisfied with my phone.
Huawei doesn't make a premium phone, even their high end phones aren't premium,However,they do make good low-mid range phones for less than $300,Temper your expectations and you will be satisifed.
The most trusted mobile phone manufacturer ever,but After many times calling for warranty cover,and got nothing Useless warranty.
