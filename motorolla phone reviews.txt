i have Bought Moto G Stylus,Worst phone ever,WiFi doesn't work and have tried every single way of checking it.
Bought a Motorola e6+ sim free from Argos only Â£79.95 to replace a Samsung galaxy that died after about 1 year soon after the warranty expired,This Motorola is an EXCELLENT phone, does everything a smartphone does, at a speed,and an excellent buy. 
MOTOROLLA CELL PHONES ARE PATHETIC,THEY ARE THE WORST I HAVE EVER MADE THE MISTAKE OF USING.
