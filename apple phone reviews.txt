Apple's iPhone 12 mini delivers the best price-to-power ratio of any 2020 iPhone, bringing top-of-the-line features to a phone that easily fits into smaller hands.
The iPhone XS Max is the best expression of Apple's smartphone philosophy so far, with a giant, gorgeous screen connecting you to everything.
The Apple iPhone SE is the best choice if you're looking for a small, but powerful smartphone.
I've had a few iPhones over the years now and they are absolutely enjoyable to use,Apple seems to really take the time to elevate and perfect the user experience,The craftsmanship and quality of the material is best-in-class,I also appreciate Apple's high regard for security and privacy.
Apple is very sorry I am so disappointed that I switched from android to them,This will be my first and last iPhone,Only had the stupid device for less than five months and Iâ€™m so dissatisfied.
the phone was overall amazing the camera quality , the speed and every thing was appreciable but you people have god the worst prices in history and worst battery life.
